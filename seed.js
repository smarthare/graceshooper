          description: 'Iconic tone in a limited edition amazing design. In the pantheon of great amps, there are few that stand the test of time like the Fender Princeton and its signature clean tones. There‚Äôs that long, luscious spring reverb that lets players dial in everything from ethereal echoes to cavernous swirls. There‚Äôs that recognizable Princeton tremolo, which pulses with pure Fender character through every passage and performance. Clearly, its rich tone and responsiveness have given it an unmistakable voice. The relationship between classic Fender amps and Jensen speakers has long existed, and they"ve long been part of the recipe that results in those beloved tones. But true to its namesake, the switch from 10 in. to 12 in. speaker serves up a little something extra for tone chasers‚Äîcrystal clear wine glass fidelity with plenty of low-end punch and attitude when cranked‚Äîa slight differentiation from the tonal quality of the famous Princeton. The Limited Edition Princeton 112 Bordeaux Reserve is a drool-worthy collectable for the discerning amp enthusiast seeking a cosmetically unique amp as well. Also in line with its moniker, the Bordeaux Reserve features a classy yet understated wine red textured vinyl covering and, paired with traditional wheat-colored grille cloth, offers an air of sophistication that only a Fender Princeton can exude.',

The Marshall 1974X 18W 1x12 Combo Amp is a handwired reissue of the model 1974, a combo originally produced from 1965 to 1968. Introduced as a practice combo amp in 1965, it wasnt as loud as the terror-inducing heads Marshall was producing, but it could rock, giving up incredible lead and crunch sounds at low volumes. The 1974X combo comes with 2 EL84 tubes in the power amp, 3 ECC83s in the preamp, an EZ81 rectifier tube, and features valve-driven tremolo. A proprietary, aged reissue of the 20W, ceramic magnet Celestion T1221 speaker used in the original adds to the Marshall 1974Xs tonal authenticity. Marshall includes a footswitch with your 1974X Combo Amp.',

Every Gibson guitar has the same issues 1.the strings binding in the nut creating tuning instability and 2.the headstock breaking off if the guitar gets an impact there. Gibson simply wont fix these very basic issues because it is not being true to the original Gibson guitars of the 50s and 60s.....But there is value here. The neck plays like a dream, better than any of my other guitars. It just feels right and its extremely easy to fret. I set mine up with 10s and dont suggest using anything lighter. The pickups sound great and now that Gibson gave us all four knobs on the Studio version, the range of tones matches that from the more expensive 335s. Honestly, I dont see any reason to spend more. This guitar looks great with its translucent finish and black binding, I have the red one, and the other 335s will have the same issues that this less expensive model has.', rating: 4, productId: products[1].id, userId: 2 }),
